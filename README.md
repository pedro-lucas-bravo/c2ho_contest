# Generated Logo for C2HO

# Concept

This logo is based on the description of the iniciative and a chemical formula related to the name (C2HO), as well as the concept of a network and some elements relevant to it according to the goals of the hub.

# How to run?

The source code is implemented in Python using a Jupiter notebook, the file is 'c2ho_logo.ipynb'. The code can be run simply by executing the whole notebook. The last cell generates the renders, if you want to play the result again just execute the cell where 'ipd.display' commands are being used (one cell before the last one) after a full run.

# How to play?

There is a HTML file and a .wav file that goes together in the 'Render' folder. Open the .html file in a browser and press 'START'. The animated SVG will play together with the audio. It might be a bit unsync in the first play, but if you play 'START' again you will notice that image and sound are in sync with the animations that are happening at the begining.
